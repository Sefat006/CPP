**Here are some Codeforces problems suitable for beginners to practice map and set concepts:**

**Problem 1: Beautiful Numbers**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/300/C](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/300/C)
* **Difficulty:** 800
* **Idea:** Use a set to store the unique digits of a number. If the set's size is equal to the number of digits, the number is beautiful.

**Problem 2: Yet Another Two Integers Problem**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1409/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1409/A)
* **Difficulty:** 800
* **Idea:** Use a map to store the frequency of each operation. Iterate through the map and calculate the final value.

**Problem 3: Distinct Digits**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1228/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1228/A)
* **Difficulty:** 800
* **Idea:** Use a set to store the digits of a number. If the set's size is equal to the number of digits, the number is good.

**Problem 4: Wrong Subtraction**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/977/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/977/A)
* **Difficulty:** 800
* **Idea:** Simulate the process of subtracting 1 from the last digit or dividing by 10. Use a string to store the number and update it iteratively.

**Problem 5: Lucky Division**
* **Problem Link:** [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/122/A](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/122/A)
* **Difficulty:** 800
* **Idea:** Check if the number is divisible by any lucky number (numbers containing only 4 and 7). You can precompute a set of lucky numbers and iterate through it to check divisibility.

**Additional Tips:**

* **Practice regularly:** Consistent practice is key to improving your problem-solving skills.
* **Analyze solutions:** Study the solutions of others, especially the ones with high ratings.
* **Participate in contests:** Contests help you learn to solve problems under time pressure.
* **Use a good code editor:** A good code editor can help you write and debug your code more efficiently.
* **Don't be afraid to ask for help:** If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask for help from others.

By practicing these problems and following these tips, you can improve your skills in using maps and sets in C++.
